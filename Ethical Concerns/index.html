              Collecting and utilizing genetic data raises significant ethical
              issues, particularly regarding privacy and informed consent. When
              individuals provide their genetic information for testing or
              research purposes, it's essential to ensure their data's
              confidentiality and respect their autonomy.

            <p>
              Informed consent plays a crucial role in genetic engineering. It

              about the purposes, risks, and potential benefits of genetic
              testing or research. It allows individuals to make informed
              decisions about whether to participate. Genetic data is highly
              sensitive and personal, and individuals must willingly agree to
              its use, knowing how it will be employed and who will have access
              to it.

              The concept of "designer babies" is a topic of ethical concern in
              genetic engineering. This term refers to the idea of using genetic
              technology to select specific traits or characteristics in unborn
              children, such as appearance, intelligence, or athletic ability.
              The ethical dilemma here is whether it is morally justifiable to
              manipulate a child's genetic makeup for non-medical reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
              While genetic engineering has the potential to prevent genetic
              diseases and disorders, the idea of enhancing traits for
              non-medical purposes raises concerns about playing a role in
              determining a child's future and limiting their autonomy. The
              debate around designer babies often centers on finding a balance
              between medical necessity and non-medical enhancement.
